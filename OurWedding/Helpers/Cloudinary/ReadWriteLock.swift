 Swift wrapper for pthread read/write lock, synchronization between threads to a resource.

 The lock can be acquired for reading when there are no writers waiting for the lock
 or owning the lock.

 The lock can be acquired for writing when there are no readers or other writers owning the lock.

 Intending to use this class? You probably should see about redesigning
 your code and / or using GCD.
